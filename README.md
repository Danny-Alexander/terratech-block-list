## Current features

### Show/hide columns

### Save or copy the data

Copy/export into a spreadsheet (includes hidden columns). This is like flattening the json data file.

## Planned features

### Recipe and raw cost columns

### Function specific properties

## Feedback

Both negative and positive is welcome - I've been winging this one for the most part from the get-go having almost no prior experience with html, jquery, DataTables, setting up GitHub projects, GitKraken integration etc.

## Notes

I wish I'd done this using Vue framework now and am tempted to put time into setting it up with that instead.
